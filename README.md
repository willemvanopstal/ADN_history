# ADN_history
partial history of RBB.

This is an online dataset containing downloaded images of the 'Representatief Bathymetrisch Bestand'. Downloaded just after an update to this (external) dataset. The data in this repository is used in the ADN-applet to compare the newest available dataset to an older one.

NB: historical data is manually downloaded by me and then uploaded again onto this repository. If you can contribute to an automated way, please do so and notify me by sending a message.
